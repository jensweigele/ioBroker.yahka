## Installation and Usage
For details on how to install and configure this adapter, please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/jensweigele/ioBroker.yahka/wiki)

## Prerequisites
Before you can install the Adapter, you have to some packages (for Linux):
`sudo apt-get install libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev`

## Install the latest **Release**
Just hit the "+" button behind "Homekit yahka adapter" in the ioBroker Admin Panel on the "Adapter" page.

## Install the latest **Beta**
If you want to be on the edge and test the latest beta, you could install the adapter via the ioBroker beta repository.

(Sometimes an additional upload (e.g. `iobroker upload yahka`) and adapter restart is necessary)

## Backup & Restore
Attention: To be able to restore `ioBroker.yahka` on another system, in addition to the usual `iobroker backup` and `iobroker restore`, the `yahka.X.hapdata` folder under `/opt/iobroker/iobroker-data` must also be backuped and, if necessary, restored. [Wiki](https://github.com/jensweigele/ioBroker.yahka/wiki/ioBroker.yahka-auf-ein-anderes-System-umziehen) / [Issue](https://github.com/jensweigele/ioBroker.yahka/issues/176)

Another option for a backup and restore is the [Backitup](https://github.com/simatec/ioBroker.backitup/blob/master/README.md) adapter. This automatically backs up the `yahka.X.hapdata` folder.
A restore is also possible via the BackItUp GUI.

You can find a detailed description [here](https://github.com/simatec/ioBroker.backitup/wiki/ioBroker.backitup-Wiki-Deutsch#yahka-backup).

## Troubleshooting

### The bridge is not working or a device is not responding
Try to change the MAC/Username of the bridge or activate the ciao advertiser

### Not all new features are available:
If not all new features are available after a yahka update, try an upload (e.g. `iob upload yahka`) and restart the adapter. 

### Missing Avahi daemon (linux)
If you are having the following error in the log:

```
Error:	2016-07-26 18:57:17.989	error	at Error (native)
Error:	2016-07-26 18:57:17.989	error	dns service error: unknown
uncaught	2016-07-26 18:57:17.985	error	exception: dns service error: unknown
```

You have to do some additional steps:
* install avahi daemon:
`sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon -y`

* Edit avahi-daemon.conf
`sudo nano avahi-daemon.conf `

change the following variables:
```
host-name=\<put in your hostname\>
domain-name=local
use-ipv4=yes
use-ipv6=yes
enable-dbus=yes
```

### Missing pam-devel Package (linux)
If you are having the following error in the log:

```
../authenticate_pam.cc:30:31: fatal error: security/pam_appl.h: Datei oder Verzeichnis nicht gefunden
#include <security/pam_appl.h>
```

You have to install the pam-devel package:

* install avahi daemon:
`sudo apt-get install pam-devel -y`

### Missing bonjour (windows) 
- Download: `https://www.samuelattard.com/files/bonjourcore2.msi`
- Execute: `msiexec /i bonjourcore2.msi /qn`
- remove: `del bonjourcore2.msi`
- Download: `https://www.samuelattard.com/files/bonjoursdksetup.exe`
- Execute: `bonjoursdksetup.exe /quiet`
- Remove: `del bonjoursdksetup.exe`
- Set: `set BONJOUR_SDK_HOME=C:\Program Files\Bonjour SDK`

And after that, install yahka adapter.

## Some words about HomeKit
The architecture of HomeKit is as follows:

There are **devices** as logical entities. Each device can have multiple **services** and each service has multiple **characteristics**.

At the end, a characteristic is an endpoint where values could be read from or write to.

Which characteristics a service could have, is defined by Apple/HomeKit and determined by the service type. The service types are also defined by Apple/HomeKit.

Example:

A Garage Door opener is a device that could have two services:

1. Garage Door Opener 
2. Light

The Garage Door Opener Service itself could have different characteristics like: CurrentDoorState, TargetDoorState and many more.

Also, the Light Service could have different characteristics, like: On (and many others for changing the light color etc.)

## What Yahka does
With Yahka it is possible to map an ioBroker Datapoint to a HomeKit Characteristic.

Since sometimes mappings are necessary (e.g., the "State" values of a garage door are different between HomeKit and other systems), there is also the possibility to specify Functions to convert the values. This is described below.

To avoid too much administration work, all Devices you create in Yahka are behind a so-called "Bridge". With this bridge, you only need to pair the Bridge with your iOS device to get access to all devices. Otherwise, you would need to pair every Yahka device with Homekit.

## Set up the Bridge and create devices and services 
Each device that needs to be paired with Homekit needs a "username" which has the form of a mac-address. Yahka automatically generates a random username for each yahka instance.

**Important: if you change the username after pairing Yahka with HomeKit, you need to reconfigure all devices in iOS (room assignment, position etc.). Changing the username means to iOS that it is a completely new device!**

Besides the username, you need to specify a PIN code which needs to be entered on the iOS device.
This could all be specified by clicking on ":yahka.0" in the admin panel of Yahka. (Expand the Panel on the right side after clicking on the list entry). The name of the bridge could also be changed there.

After setting up the bridge, you could add the devices you like with the "Add Device" Button on the top.
Once a device is added/selected, you could add services to this device.

It is necessary to specify a service name and a service type.

Depending on the service type, the list of available characteristic changes.

## Setting up Characteristics
If you want to support a characteristic, you have to tick the "enabled" checkbox on the left side of the characteristic.
For each characteristic, you could specify the following properties:
- InOutFunction: you could specify a predefined function which is responsible for passing the values from HomeKit to ioBroker and vice versa
- InOutParameter: here you could specify parameters for the selected InOutFunction. The available/expected Parameters depend on the selected Function. A brief overview of the Functions and Parameters are stated below.
- ConversionFunction: additionally to the InOutFunction, you could also specify a function which converts a value coming from HomeKit to ioBroker (and vice versa)
- ConversionParameter: same as InOutParameter - the available/expected params depend on the selected function.

## Homematic Blind Actuator \ Window Covering
To integrate the Homematic Blind Actuators (like HM-LC-Bl1PBU-FM), the following settings are necessary:

* Add a service to a device
* Set Service Name to some name and service type to "WindowCovering". Service subtype could be left blank
* Enable and fill in the following characteristics:

| Characteristic Name | 1: InOut Function <br> 2: Conversion Function                             | 1: InOut Parameters <br> 2: Conversion Parameters              |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| CurrentPosition     | 1: ioBroker.State.OnlyACK<br>2: passthrough                               | 1: _\<path to homematic object\>_.1.LEVEL<br> 2: \<empty\>     |
| PositionState       | 1: ioBroker.State.OnlyACK<br>2: HomematicDirectionToHomekitPositionState  | 1: _\<path to homematic object\>_.1.DIRECTION<br> 2: \<empty\> |
| TargetPosition      | 1: ioBroker.homematic.WindowCovering.TargetPosition<br>2: passthrough     | 1: _\<path to homematic object\>_.1.LEVEL<br> 2: \<empty\>     |

The value _\<path to Homematic object\>_ needs to be replaced with the actual path to the device (e.g., hm-rpc.0.NEQ0012345)

For general Information about the Configuration Mask, see: TODO

For more information about the Configuration, the InOut Functions and Conversion Functions, see: [Wiki](https://github.com/jensweigele/ioBroker.yahka/wiki/Configuration,-InOut-Functions-and-Conversion-Functions)

## Notes for developers

This repo includes one submodule, so before building you need to also close/init this one, e.g., use `git submodule update --init --recursive` to update and fetch it's content.
